# Intro
This is the github page for the Jet Fuel33, a 3x11 ortholinear keyboard that is compatible with alps and mx switches, it also features usb-c.
the layout in this repo is my personal one which is made for use with swerty, although all the files necessary to make your own are available here too.

# Description
My goal with this project was to create the ideal keyboard for me, ever since i got started with the custom keyboard "hobby" i have always been eyeing small keyboards (40% size or smaller). The first custom keyboard i bought was an Orthodox, wich is a 40% split ortholinear ergonomic keyboard. after some consideration i decided that 3x11 would be the optimal layout for me, and since i did not find any existing designs that were 3x11 and used USB-C i decided to design my own keyboard. after teaching myself how to use the pcb design program Kicad i also figured out how to design parts for laser cutting, as that was the method i decided to use for making the case. The original idea was to use a case made out of 5 3mm thick layers of clear acrylic with some standoffs and screws to hold it together. But after making the first prototype i realised that using just 4 layers is possible with some slight modifications to the bottom plate, the modification in question was cutting out a small notch beneath where the usb port is located, otherwise the port gets a bit squished. Making the case have 3mm less room inside which makes it sound slightly better. I have also made one keyboard with a case made out of 3mm thick pieces of high grade birch plywood that were glued together permanently. The use of plywood greatly improves the sound when typing in my opinion.
